## Getting Super Powers Today \(if that's ok with everyone\)

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```text
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="success" %}
HINT: Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
WARNING: Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
DANGER: Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
SUCCESS: Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```text
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
